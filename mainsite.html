            <h2>The Scout <img src="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/archive/1/16/20130809194606%21Scout_emblem_BLU.png" width="75px" height="75px"/></h2>
            <p>1.) Master the Double Jump: Use the Scout’s quick double jump to reach unexpected places, dodge enemy fire, and access tricky routes.</p>
            <p>2.) Use the Pistol Effectively: The Scout’s pistol is a powerful secondary weapon. Practice quick, accurate shots to finish off enemies or disable key targets. </p>
            <p>3.) Know Your Map: Familiarize yourself with map layouts, shortcuts, and high ground spots to keep your enemies on their toes. </p>
            <p>4.) Stay Moving and Use Hit-and-Run Tactics: The Scout excels at hit-and-run gameplay. Keep moving to avoid being an easy target and pick off enemies quickly. </p>
            <p>5.) Focus on Flanking: Use speed to flank enemies and attack from unexpected angles, disrupting their formations. </p>
            <p>6.) Use the Sandman or Boston Basher (if allowed): For disruptive plays or defending objectives, these weapons can be very effective. </p>
            <p>7.) Play Smart with the Force-a-Nature: Its knockback can push enemies off edges or disrupt chokes, but be mindful of its recoil. </p>
            <p>8.) Prioritize Objectives: The Scout can be crucial for capturing points or pushing the cart due to his speed and agility. </p>
            <p>9.) Communicate with Your Team: Call out enemy positions and coordinate attacks for maximum impact. </p>
            <p>10.) Use the Scattergun for Close Combat: Get close to enemies for maximum damage, especially in chaotic skirmishes. </p>

                <h2> The Soldier <img src="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/d/de/Soldier_emblem_RED.png" width="75px" height="75px"></h2>
                <p>1.) Master Rocket Jumping: Use your rocket launcher to propel yourself to high ground, cross gaps, or surprise enemies. Practice timing and positioning for safe and effective jumps.</p>
                <p>2.) Aim for Critical Hits: Aim for headshots to maximize damage. The Soldier’s rocket launcher can deal critical hits when aimed precisely.</p>
                <p>3.) Use Cover and Terrain to Your Advantage: Use walls, corners, and high ground to protect yourself while firing. Rocket jumps can also help you reach advantageous positions.</p>
                <p>4.) Switch Between Primary and Secondary Weapons Wisely: Use the shotgun for close encounters and the Equalizer or other secondary weapons for specific situations.</p>
                <p>5.) Keep Moving: Constant movement makes it harder for enemies to hit you. Strafe and jump unpredictably.</p>
                <p>6.) Use the Concheror for Unexpected Pushes: When timed right, the Concheror can give you a speed boost and extra damage, useful for breaking enemy lines or pushing the cart.</p>
                <p>7.) Target High-Value Enemies: Focus on snipers, Medics, and Engineers to weaken enemy defenses and support your team.</p>
                <p>8.) Practice Aim and Leading Shots: Rocket travel time is a factor; lead enemy movement to land hits more consistently.</p>
                <p>9.) Communicate with Your Team: Call out enemy positions, especially snipers or Engineers that need to be taken out.</p>
                <p>10.) Use the Battlefield to Your Advantage: Take advantage of choke points, doorways, and narrow corridors to maximize rocket hits and splash damage.</p>

                <h2> The Pyro <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Pyro_emblem_BLU.png" width="75px" height="75px"></h2>
                <p>1.) Master Close-Range Combat: The Pyro excels at close quarters. Use your flamethrower to surprise enemies and push them back.</p>
                <p>2.) Use Airblast Effectively: The airblast can reflect projectiles, extinguish burning teammates, and push enemies away. Practice timing it to deflect rockets, grenades, or enemy goo.</p>
                <p>3.) Master Spamming Air and Walls: Use your flamethrower to consistently pressure enemies around corners or behind cover. Aim at their feet or walls to control space.</p>
                <p>4.) Practice Sticky Jumping (if using the Detonator or other sticky-based weapons): It can help you reach high ground or flank enemies unexpectedly.</p>
                <p>5.) Be Invisible to Certain Enemies: Pyro’s backburner creates a stealth effect when flames are burning enemies from behind, making it harder for enemies to defend against you.</p>
                <p>6.) Use Combustion for Pushes: Pyro can quickly clear enemy camps or choke points by spamming fire and airblast.</p>
                <p>7.) Use the shotgun or other secondary weapons for finishing off fleeing enemies or when you need more range.</p>
                <p>8.) Stay Mobile: Keep moving to avoid being an easy target. Flank enemies from unexpected angles to catch them off guard.</p>
                <p>9.) Extinguish Burning Teammates: Always watch your team and extinguish teammates on fire to keep them alive longer.</p>
                <p>10.) Build Map Awareness: Know the map layout to find the best spots for ambushes, escape routes, and flanking.</p>

                <p>1.) Master Grenade Arcing: Learn to arc your grenades properly - they bounce and roll, so practice predicting where enemies will be when they explode.</p>
                <p>2.) Use Stickybomb Traps Strategically: Place sticky bombs around corners, on ceilings, or near health packs to catch enemies off guard when they least expect it.</p>
                <p>3.) Learn Sticky Jumping: Master sticky jumping to reach high ground, escape danger, or surprise enemies from unexpected angles - just watch your health!</p>
                <p>4.) Control Chokepoints: Use your explosive area damage to deny enemies access through doorways, corridors, and narrow passages.</p>
                <p>5.) Time Your Detonations: Don't detonate stickies immediately - let enemies walk into your traps or use the delay to your tactical advantage.</p>
                <p>6.) Protect Your Team's Flank: Set up sticky traps on alternate routes to prevent enemy flankers from sneaking up on your team.</p>
                <p>7.) Use the Grenade Launcher for Direct Combat: Practice direct hits with grenades for maximum damage - they do more damage on direct impact than after bouncing.</p>
                <p>8.) Reload Constantly: Both your primary and secondary weapons have long reload times, so reload whenever you have a safe moment.</p>
                <p>9.) Work with Your Team: Coordinate with Engineers to protect their buildings, and stay near Medics who can keep you healed through self-damage.</p>
                <p>10.) Learn Rollout Timing: On competitive maps, learn the sticky jump rollouts to get to mid-points quickly and gain positional advantages.</p>

                <h2> The Heavy <img src="https://marketplace.tf/images/class_emblems/Heavy.png" width="75px" height="75px"></h2>
                <p>1.) Pre-spin Your Minigun: Start spinning up your minigun before rounding corners or when you expect enemies - the spin-up time can be deadly if caught off guard.</p>
                <p>2.) Use Cover Effectively: You're a big, slow target, so always position yourself near walls, corners, or objects you can duck behind to avoid damage.</p>
                <p>3.) Master the Sandvich: Your Sandvich can fully heal you and can be thrown to heal teammates - use it strategically and find safe spots to eat it.</p>
                <p>4.) Stay with Your Team: Heavy works best when supporting teammates, especially near Medics, Engineers, or Pyros who can watch your back.</p>
                <p>5.) Control Your Movement: You move very slowly while spun up, so learn when to spin down and reposition versus when to stay spun up and tank damage.</p>
                <p>6.) Watch Your Flanks: Spies, Scouts, and Soldiers love to attack you from behind or above - constantly check around you and listen for footsteps.</p>
                <p>7.) Use the Fists of Steel: When moving between positions, switch to Fists of Steel to reduce ranged damage and get to safety faster.</p>
                <p>8.) Deny Area Access: Your massive damage output can completely shut down chokepoints and doorways - use this to control map areas.</p>
                <p>9.) Communicate with Medics: Call for Medic when you need healing, and protect them at all costs - a Heavy-Medic combo is incredibly powerful.</p>
                <p>10.) Learn Damage Falloff: Get as close as possible to enemies for maximum minigun damage - your weapon becomes much weaker at long range.</p>

                <h2> The Engineer<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Engineer_emblem_RED.png" width="75px" height="75px"></h2>
                <p>1.) Master Sentry Placement: Place your sentry in corners or areas with good cover where it can watch multiple angles but enemies can't easily peek and destroy it.</p>
                <p>2.) Always Keep Metal Stocked: Constantly collect metal from ammo packs, dispensers, and fallen weapons - you need it for building, upgrading, and repairs.</p>
                <p>3.) Upgrade in Safe Spots: Build your buildings in safe areas away from enemy fire, then use the Rescue Ranger or carry them to better positions once upgraded.</p>
                <p>4.) Use Your Dispenser Strategically: Place dispensers near your team's fighting positions to keep everyone healed and supplied with ammo - they're often more valuable than sentries.</p>
                <p>5.) Watch for Spies Constantly: Spies are your biggest threat - constantly spycheck with your wrench, watch for suspicious teammates, and listen for decloak sounds.</p>
                <p>6.) Learn the Rescue Ranger: This weapon lets you heal buildings from long range and grab them to safety when they're under attack.</p>
                <p>7.) Build Teleporter Networks: Teleporters can completely change the game flow - upgrade them to level 3 and place exit points in safe but useful locations.</p>
                <p>8.) Use the Wrangler for Defense: The Wrangler shield can make your sentry nearly indestructible and extends its range - perfect for stopping enemy pushes.</p>
                <p>9.) Rotate Your Buildings: Don't get attached to one spot - move your buildings as the battle flow changes and team needs shift.</p>
                <p>10.) Support Your Team: Drop dispensers near the front lines, use your shotgun in combat, and remember that helping your team is often better than hiding behind your sentry.</p>

                <h2> The Medic <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Medic_emblem_RED.png" width="75px" height="75px"></h2>
                <p>1.) Stay Behind Cover: Always position yourself behind walls, corners, or teammates - you're a high-priority target and need protection to stay alive.</p>
                <p>2.) Master the Crossbow: The Crusader's Crossbow heals teammates from long range and does more healing the farther they are - practice your aim with it.</p>
                <p>3.) Overheal Everyone: Buff teammates to 150% health when you have time - overhealed players are much more effective in combat and survive longer.</p>
                <p>4.) Use Uber Strategically: Don't waste your Ubercharge - coordinate with your team and use it to push through chokepoints or counter enemy Ubers.</p>
                <p>5.) Prioritize Healing Targets: Heavy and Soldier first for damage, then other combat classes - but always heal anyone critically injured regardless of class.</p>
                <p>6.) Surf Damage to Escape: When taking knockback damage, use it to surf away from enemies and create distance to survive longer.</p>
                <p>7.) Communicate Constantly: Call out enemy positions, Spy warnings, and coordinate Uber pushes - your team relies on your information and leadership.</p>
                <p>8.) Stay Mobile and Unpredictable: Keep moving, use different routes, and don't be predictable - Snipers and Spies will target you first.</p>
                <p>9.) Watch Your Uber Percentage: Keep track of enemy Medic Uber percentages and communicate advantage/disadvantage to your team for better timing.</p>
                <p>10.) Use Multiple Medi-guns: The Kritzkrieg for offense, stock Uber for defense, and Quick-Fix for keeping your team alive during intense fights.</p>

                <h2> The Sniper <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Sniper_emblem_BLU_%28beta%29.png" width="75px" height="75px"></h2>
                <p>1.) Master Your Scope Timing: Learn to quickscope for 150 damage headshots - you don't always need to fully charge for maximum damage against lighter classes.</p>
                <p>2.) Change Positions Frequently: Never stay in the same spot too long - enemy Snipers, Spies, and Soldiers will hunt you down if you're predictable.</p>
                <p>3.) Prioritize High-Value Targets: Focus on enemy Medics, other Snipers, and Engineers first - eliminating these classes helps your team push forward effectively.</p>
                <p>4.) Use the SMG for Close Combat: When enemies get close, switch to your SMG and backpedal while firing - don't try to noscope everything at close range.</p>
                <p>5.) Learn Common Sightlines: Memorize popular Sniper spots and angles on each map so you can pre-aim and counter-snipe effectively.</p>
                <p>6.) Communicate Enemy Positions: Call out flanking Scouts, Spies, and other threats to help your team - your elevated position gives you great vision.</p>
                <p>7.) Use the Razorback Against Spies: If enemy Spies are targeting you constantly, equip the Razorback to force them to use their gun instead of backstabbing.</p>
                <p>8.) Body Shot When Necessary: Sometimes a 150 damage body shot is better than missing a headshot - especially against low-health enemies trying to escape.</p>
                <p>9.) Watch Your Flanks Constantly: Check behind you regularly and listen for footsteps - Scouts and Spies love to target isolated Snipers.</p>
                <p>10.) Use Jarate for Team Support: Throw Jarate at groups of enemies or on teammates who are on fire - the mini-crits help your entire team deal more damage.</p>

                <p>1.) Master Your Disguises: Use enemy disguises that make sense for the situation - avoid slow classes like Heavy when you need to move quickly, and pick common classes like Soldier or Scout</p>
                <p>2.) Learn Backstab Angles: Practice getting behind enemies smoothly - you need to be directly behind them for the backstab to register, so work on your positioning and timing.</p>
                <p>3.) Use Your Revolver Effectively: Don't rely only on backstabs - the revolver does good damage and can finish off weakened enemies from a safe distance.</p>
                <p>4.) Time Your Decloaks Carefully: Decloak behind cover where enemies can't hear you - the decloak sound is very loud and will give you away if you're not careful.</p>
                <p>5.) Target High-Priority Enemies: Focus on Medics, Engineers, Snipers, and other key targets that will help your team push forward when eliminated.</p>
                <p>6.) Use the Dead Ringer Strategically: Fake your death when taking damage, then use the speed boost and damage resistance to escape or reposition for another attack.</p>
                <p>7.) Sap Buildings in the Right Order: Sap the sentry first to stop it from firing, then quickly sap other buildings - or sap the dispenser first if the Engineer isn't nearby.</p>
                <p>8.) Act Like Your Disguise: Walk toward "enemy" positions, don't look directly at "enemies", and occasionally "shoot" at "teammates" to sell your disguise convincingly.</p>
                <p>9.) Learn Common Engineer Spots: Memorize where Engineers typically build so you can find and eliminate their nests more efficiently.</p>
                <p>10.) Stay Patient and Pick Your Moments: Don't rush into groups of enemies - wait for isolated targets or distracted enemies during team fights.</p>
